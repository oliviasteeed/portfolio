                    <h4>outcome</h4>
                    <p>This interface design course project was centered around creating a digital product in response to interviewing, researching and testing intended users, in this case, seniors 75+. We designed a mobile app that connects to patients' official health records using their Personal Health Number to give them a centralized hub of health information including conditions, medications and appointments. Supplementary information helps users understand health outcomes, and appointment notes keep health guidance available on-demand, empowering seniors to continue independent living.

                    <p>The project started by interviewing seniors to understand their goals and challenges as well as opinions on technology, and supplementing these insights with secondary research. Three concepts were developed, but HealthConnect was pursued due to its clear connection to the needs of interviewed seniors and the potential to help further their goals of independent living. The concept was developed through persona development, usage scenario creation, user flow mapping and the creation of wireframes and mockups. This was translated into a fully interactive prototype used in usability testing and further developed based on testing results. A promotional website was also created to advertise the product and share the creation process.

                    <h4>challenge</h4>
                    <p>Forming a coherent concept from the many different sources of information was difficult at times, as it is hard to translate user concerns and goals into an actionable concept that could address them. We did not conduct user interviews with an agenda of what intervention to create which allowed us to openly explore the opinions of seniors but also could lead to broad and unfocused interviews. Once we had developed a concept it would have been helpful to conduct user interviews again with more focus to work out the nuances of each feature, but testing was limited by time constraints.

                    <h4>reflection</h4>
                    <p>This project introduced me to driving a project with user interviews and usability testing. I was amazed at how insightful talking to intended users was and will integrate both this and usability testing into future projects to ensure they are meeting user goals, not my assumptions of user goals. If I could redo this project I would interview intended users several times as the concept was developed to get more specific information about the project. I would also interview and test more intended users to get a broader array of opinions to ensure accessibility for diverse audiences.</p>
