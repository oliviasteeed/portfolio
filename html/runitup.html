                    <h4>outcome</h4>
                    <p> This course project was focused on harnessing the everpresent and connected nature of mobile
                        devices to create a positive experience and impact. In a team of two, I designed and developed a
                        running application that motivates users to run by encouraging them to set goals, reflect on
                        their progress and set run reminders. Users can input past runs, schedule future runs, and
                        record current runs, during which their steps, pace, activity time, calories burned, and route
                        are saved. Saved stats are displayed by run and stat to illustrate progress, encouraging users
                        to continue their fitness journey.</p>

                    <p>I mapped the user flow to decide what features were necessary to create a positive user
                        experience and created mockups of the interface before beginning development in Android Studio.
                        Throughout development, I continued to iterate the content and interface to ensure the app was
                        visually pleasing and understandable. Focusing on user health and well-being were key goals, so
                        the app included recovery information and an emphasis on personal accountability and performance
                        progress over aesthetics.</p>

                    <h4>challenge</h4>
                    <p>This project was open-ended and I went beyond the required scope to create a complex app without
                        compromising the user experience or functionality. This allowed me to do a lot of self-guided
                        learning with online resources and get more out of the course than the limited topics covered,
                        but also meant I spent a lot of time troubleshooting code errors, and being generally confused.
                        The time I invested in this project made me very comfortable identifying and fixing issues
                        myself, as well as sourcing resources online when I needed more information. I learned to
                        diagram out exactly what I wanted to do, and then think of solutions once I understood each
                        requirement of the functionality.</p>

                    <h4>reflection</h4>
                    <p>This project allowed me to apply the content learned in user experience and interface design
                        courses to the creation of an app from concept to execution. I challenged myself to learn more
                        than the course content to create an app I was proud of and gained an enthusiasm for solving
                        code errors and much appreciation for Stack Overflow. In the future, I would plan the activity
                        content concretely before starting development to make the development process smoother, but I
                        also appreciated the iterations that co-creation facilitated so would not close the door on
                        improving the concept during development.</p>
